The offshore windfarm site is located in the eastern Irish Sea, in water depths of 18-40m. The windfarm has an expected nominal capacity of 480MW. The offshore windfarm site is situated in the vicinity of the South Morecambe Gas Fields (which are currently expected to cease production around 2027 (+/-2 years)). An important factor in the windfarm site’s selection was the potential for the project to be the first windfarm to fully co-exist with oil and gas operations on previously developed seabed. The offshore windfarm site was selected as part of The Crown Estate’s Offshore Wind Leasing Round 4. Several operational windfarms are located near the site. Two larger Round 4 offshore windfarms are also planned to the west of the site. The Morecambe offshore windfarm t will help achieve the UK Government’s commitment to net zero by 2050 and tackle the climate emergency by producing electricity from renewable energy.",

Development at the site will also include the following associated measures to allow access to and from the site by road, rail or river, with a correspondingly reduced environmental impact: i. an extension to Flixborough Wharf; ii. the reopening of a 9km single track railway line that connects Flixborough Wharf with the steel works at Scunthorpe; iii. a railhead complex to handle the RDF and concrete products; and iv. a new road alignment to facilitate the flow of traffic accessing the site from the south.",

The offshore windfarm site is situated in the vicinity of the South Morecambe Gas Fields (which are currently expected to cease production around 2027 (+/-2 years)). An important factor in the windfarm site’s selection was the potential for the project to be the first windfarm to fully co-exist with oil and gas operations on previously developed seabed. The offshore windfarm site was selected as part of The Crown Estate’s Offshore Wind Leasing Round 4. Several operational windfarms are located near the site. Two larger Round 4 offshore windfarms are also planned to the west of the site.
