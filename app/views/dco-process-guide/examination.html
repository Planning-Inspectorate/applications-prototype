                <p>The Examination stage is where the Examining Authority, the developer and anyone who has registered to have their say will get involved and comment on the proposed development at a number of set deadlines.</p>
                <p>This is done in writing using the online form unless there is a need for hearings. If hearings need to take place, they are usually about specific issues that need to be discussed in more detail. Anyone involved in the Examination can attend these hearings.</p>
                <p>This stage takes 6 months.</p>
