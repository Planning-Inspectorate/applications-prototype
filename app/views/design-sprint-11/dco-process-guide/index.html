      The process for nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs)
    </h1>
    <p class="govuk-body">Nationally significant infrastructure projects are submitted to the planning inspectorate who examines the proposal.
</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Anyone can get involved: </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>developers</li>
      <li>members of the public</li>
      <li>statutory bodies</li>
      <li>charities</li>
      <li>local authorities</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">A developer submits an application for a development consent order to the planning inspectorate. These can be developments like: </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>offshore wind farms</li>
      <li>power stations and electric lines</li>
      <li>motorways and other major roads</li>
      <li>railways</li>
      <li>gas pipelines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The planning inspectorate is a government agency. Independent inspectors make a recommendation to the relevant Secretary of State about if permission for a proposed development should be granted. The relevant Secretary of State makes the final decision. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">There are several stages in the process for considering whether a national infrastructure project should receive consent. The whole process can take around 18 months. </p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Guide for people or organisations who want to have their say</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can get involved at the pre-application stage by contacting the developer before they submit their application to the planning inspectorate. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you want to register to have your say about a national infrastructure project, you can register during the pre-examination stage. </p>
    <p>There is a <a href="../../mvp/interested-party-guide">guide</a> with information for people or organisations who want to have their say about a national infrastructure project</a>.</p>
