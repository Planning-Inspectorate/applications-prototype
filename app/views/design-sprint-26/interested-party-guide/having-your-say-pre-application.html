            <p>Before the developer sends their application for a proposed national infrastructure development to the planning inspectorate, they must carry out public consultation. This happens at the pre-application stage.</p>
            <p>The developer must consult:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>the general public</li>
              <li>parish councils</li>
              <li>statutory consultees</li>
              <li>local authorities and councils</li>
              <li>land owners and tenants</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They must gather all comments and information from members of the public and organisations. This feedback will then be taken into account and used to help shape the proposed project.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-the-developer-must-do">What the developer must do</h2>
            <p>The developer must advertise their consultation period.</p>
            <p>The advert must appear for at least two weeks and include:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>a description of the project</li>
              <li>where you can find out more about the project</li>
              <li>the deadline for sending them your comments</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The developer must also contact consultees and anyone whose land is affected by the proposed development.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-you-can-get-involved">How you can get involved at this point</h2>
            <p>The developer's application has not been sent to the planning inspectorate at this stage. You need to contact the developer to get involved.  You can search for the project on this website and find their details if there is a project page.</p>
            <p>You can also look for information in local news if you know the name of the project, or ask your local authority.</p>
            <p>Getting involved in the developer's consultation during the pre-application stage is very important. This is your opportunity to put forward any questions and concerns, and find out more about the development and how it might impact the area.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-you-can-do-if-application-submitted">What you can do if the application has already been submitted</h2>
            <p>If the developer's application has been submitted to the planning inspectorate, you can get involved by registering to have your say on this website, you can do this once the project has entered the pre-examination stage.</p>
