        Have your say about a national infrastructure project
      </h1>
      <p>This guide is for individuals and organisations who want to have their say about a project.</p>
      <p>National infrastructure projects are also called Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP). These are large scale developments like:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>offshore wind farms</li>
        <li>power stations and electric lines</li>
        <li>motorways and other major roads</li>
        <li>railways</li>
        <li>gas pipelines</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The process for national infrastructure projects is to decide if a Development Consent Order (DCO) can be granted. A DCO is a legal document that allows an applicant to build their proposed project. The applicant submits an application for a proposed development to the Planning Inspectorate. A panel of independent inspectors called the examining authority examine the project, they conduct the examination of the application, and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State about it the project should go ahead.</p>
      <p>As part of this process, anyone can have their say about the project and tell us why they think it should or should not go ahead.</p>

              <p>To get involved after the application is submitted to the Planning Inspectorate, you must register to have your say at the pre-examination stage. Pre-examination is where we prepare for an examination. We will identify an inspector or a panel of inspectors called the examining authority and make a plan for the examination stage. Registration is open for at least 30 days. The pre-examination stage takes about three months.</p>
