                <p>The Examination stage is where the Examining Authority will look at the proposed project and ask questions.</p>
                <p>The developer, anyone who is registered to have their say, and anyone else involved in the project can comment on the proposed development or answer any of the questions at each deadline.</p>
                <p>This is usually done in writing. The Examining Authority will create and publish a document of their questions. The Examination may also involve hearings if there are issues that need to be discussed in more detail.</p>
                <p>This stage takes six months.</p>
