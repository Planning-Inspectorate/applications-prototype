          The potential A404 Dewsbury to Berwick Down scheme proposes to
          construct a new section of dual carriageway to address problems
          associated with the single carriageway section of the A404 between
          Amesbury’s Countess roundabout and the dual carriageway section to the
          west of Winterbourne Stoke.
